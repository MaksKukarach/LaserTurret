# LaserTurret
 
This is the code for an automatic laser turret with a human detection feature, which I'm doing as a part of my high school project on computer vision.
Surely, you will need some arduino components for it to work properly.
*The list of those as well as some instructions will appear later.*

Also, I might make some videos of my progress, so stay tuned.
