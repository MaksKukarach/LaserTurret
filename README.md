# LaserTurret
 
This is the code for an automatic laser turret with a human detection feature.
I'm doing this as a part of my high school project on computer vision.
As you can tell, this requires some Arduino components.
*The list of those as well as some instructions will appear later.*

Also, I might make some videos of my progress, so stay tuned.
